<h3>2009-10-08</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Erlang version is very close to feature parity with the C++ codebase, once it's complete we'll deprecate the C++ project and build packages with the Erlang code.</li>
    <li>It should be a smaller download once the Erlang version is complete, and generally be faster and easier to extend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2009-10-01</h3>
<ul>
