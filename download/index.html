<h2>Downloads</h2>
<h3>Build from source if you can</h3>
<p>
Playdar is under active development, your are encouraged to compile it yourself from the 
<a href="/source.html">source code</a> if you are that way inclined.
</p>


<h3>Download Playdar Installers</h3>
<p>
    These installers will give you a recent (17/Nov/2009) install of Playdar. 
    They come with a stripped version of the Erlang runtime so you shouldn't need to install anything else to make them work.
    That said, these packages are rather new, so please be prepared to hop on IRC or the mailing list and ask for help
    if something doesn't work as expected :)
