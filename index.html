<!--#set var="title" value="Playdar - Music Content Resolver" --><!--#include virtual="/inc/header.html" -->
<p>
<span style="color:red;">Playdar is under active development. It's considered beta - we'll be packaging a 1.0-RC soon, the external API is stable, the internal API almost. There's plenty to get excited about - please join IRC/the mailing list if you have any questions or comments.</span>
</p>
<p>
Playdar is a music content resolver service - run it on every computer you use,
and you'll be able to listen to all the songs you would otherwise be able to
find manually by searching though all your computers, hard disks, online 
services, and more. 
</p>
<p>
Playdar provides a consistent API for accessing any song ever recorded. <a href="/about.html">Learn more...</a>

<p>
Playdar is written in C++ using Boost, and licensed under the GPL3.<br/>
It is 99% rewritten in Erlang under MIT license, and is far more elegant. Update on this soon.
